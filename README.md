Resume can be found in the root directory as ``resume.pdf``. The template for this resume was taken from [https://www.faangpath.com/](https://www.faangpath.com/) and the Overleaf template can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/faangpath-simple-template/npsfpdqnxmbc).

## How to build
Source to build resume is in ``/src``. 
You will need tools to build latex, I recommend following the excellent guide for TexLive [posted on the Arch Linux wikis](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TeX_Live).
